NOTES:

(1)

All sources were matched to ZFOURGE to within 1.0”. 

(2)

Spectroscopic redshifts were sourced from the 3D-HST catalogs (Skelton et al. 2014), who in turn use the zCOSMOS catalogs (Lilly et al. 2007), MMT/Hectospec data (Fabricant et al. 2005; Mink et al. 2007), the FIREWORKS catalog (Wuyts et al. 2008), and a variety of UDS sources (Yamada et al. 2005; Simpson et al. 2006; Geach et al. 2007; van Breukelen et al. 2007; Ouchi et al. 2008; Smail et al. 2008; Ono et al. 2010; Simpson et al. 2012; M. Akiyama et al., in preparation). Additionally, we crossmatch and identify additional sources from the MOSDEF survey (Kriek et al. 2015) and the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS) Le Fèvre et al. (2015).

Redshifts from the 3D-HST catalogues are limited to those with the highest quality flags in both the COSMOS and CDFS fields. For the UDS field, there is a mix of reliable and less reliable redshifts ranging from “flag not provided” to “multiple reliable features”. More details can be found in Skelton et al. (2014). 

For MOSDEF, spectroscopic redshifts are limited to those considered “robust” in Kriek et al. (2015), i.e., a secure identification and measurement of emission lines in the 1D spectra.

For VUDS, spectroscopic redshifts are limited to those rated a level 2 or higher, i.e., 75-100% probability of redshift to be correct.
